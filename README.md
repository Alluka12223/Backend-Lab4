In the previous lab we learned how to make a login. However, a login is useless unless we actually have access control. Meaning if anyone can view the pages without being logged in, then there is no point to have a login. So, in this lab we will understand how to handle access control for users and with jwt.

In this lab, we'll apply all the obtained knowledge from the previous labs and create a complete applications

The purpose of this lab is the following:
  - Understand Basic Access Control
